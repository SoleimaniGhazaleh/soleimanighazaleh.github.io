Neural oscillations often propagate as traveling waves. We tested whether frontoparietal tACS with controlled frequency/phase (4 or 7 Hz; 45° or 315°) alters WM performance and resting-state EEG in a randomized, triple-blind, sham-controlled crossover (n=29). Participants performed 2-/3-back during stimulation; resting-state EEG pre- and post-stimulation.
