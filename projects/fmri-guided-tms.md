This project investigates how electric field modeling and individualized neuroimaging data can guide TMS for SUDs. We collect structural and drug-cue fMRI prior to stimulation and define individualized targets based on functional connectivity between subcortical regions and prefrontal cortex. Computational head models optimize coil orientation, and intensity is depth-corrected by scalp-to-cortex distance.
