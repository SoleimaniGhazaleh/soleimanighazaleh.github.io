My research focuses on developing personalized neuromodulation strategies for the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) by integrating structural and functional MRI, EEG, electric field modeling, and machine learning. I lead both clinical and computational projects aimed at optimizing stimulation targets and dosing based on individual brain profiles. I am particularly interested in combining neuroimaging and stimulation data to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying addiction and to improve treatment outcomes.

My long-term goal is to advance precision medicine in addiction science through translational research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and innovative methodological approaches.
