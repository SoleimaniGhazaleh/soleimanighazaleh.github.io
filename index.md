    # Ghazaleh Soleimani  
    *(Pronounced like "Gazelle")*

    I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota with a background in engineering and a specialization in neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation, including TMS and tES techniques. During my postdoctoral training, I have worked under the mentorship of experts in both psychiatryâ€”[Dr. Kelvin O. Lim](https://www.neuroscience.umn.edu/people/kelvin-o-lim-md), [Dr. Hamed Ekhtiari](https://www.laureateinstitute.org/hamed-ekhtiari.html)â€”and biomedical engineeringâ€”[Dr. Alexander Opitz](https://cse.umn.edu/bme/alexander-opitz).

## ðŸ§  Research Overview

My research focuses on developing personalized neuromodulation strategies for the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) by integrating structural and functional MRI, EEG, electric field modeling, and machine learning. I lead both clinical and computational projects aimed at optimizing stimulation targets and dosing based on individual brain profiles. I am particularly interested in combining neuroimaging and stimulation data to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying addiction and to improve treatment outcomes.

My long-term goal is to advance precision medicine in addiction science through translational research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and innovative methodological approaches.
