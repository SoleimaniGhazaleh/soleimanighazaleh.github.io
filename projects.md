<p>
This project investigates how electric field modeling and individualized neuroimaging data can guide transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interventions for substance use disorders. We collect structural and fMRI drug cue reactivity data prior to stimulation, and perform rapid analysis to define individualized targets based on functional connectivity between subcortical regions and the prefrontal cortex. Computational head models are then used to optimize coil orientation, and stimulation intensity is adjusted based on each participantâ€™s scalp-to-cortex distance.

<p>
A preregistered, randomized, triple-blind crossover clinical trial investigating the effects of theta-phase synchronized transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on fMRI drug cue reactivity, functional connectivity, and behavioral performance. Sixty participants with opioid use disorder received 20 minutes of active or sham theta-band (6 Hz) tACS via 4Ã—1 HD electrode montages targeting the frontoparietal network (F4 and P4). Structural MRI, resting-state fMRI, and drug cue reactivity scans were collected immediately before and after stimulation.

Neural oscillations often propagate as traveling waves across the cortex, coordinating activity between distant brain regions. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) offers a promising method to modulate these dynamics noninvasively. In this study, we tested whether frontoparietal tACS, delivered with controlled frequency and phase offsets to simulate traveling waves in the theta band, could causally influence working memory performance and resting-state EEG activity. We conducted a randomized, triple-blind, sham-controlled crossover study in 29 healthy adults. Participants received four active tACS conditionsâ€”combining two frequencies (4 Hz, 7 Hz) and two phase offsets (45Â°, 315Â°)â€”and sham stimulation across two sessions. During stimulation, participants performed 2-back and 3-back working memory tasks. Resting-state EEG was recorded pre- and post-stimulation.

### High School Students Summer Program (Step-by-Step Neuroimaging-Neuromodulation Learning)

<p>
This is a <strong>scaffolded, step-by-step learning path</strong> (not a workshop series). Students progress through short modules that build on each other, each with clear goals, a brief tutorial, a checklist, and a small hands-on task. By the end, they complete a mini-capstone and present their work.
</p>

<h4>Learning Path</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Accounts, Git/GitHub, VS Code/Jupyter</li>
  <li><strong>Neuroscience & Signals 101:</strong> basic brain areas, EEG/fMRI at a glance</li>
  <li><strong>Python Fundamentals:</strong> variables, plots, reading data</li>
  <li><strong>EEG Basics:</strong> load â†’ filter â†’ visualize a simple dataset</li>
  <li><strong>fMRI Basics:</strong> anatomy â†’ slices â†’ basic viewing</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducible Science:</strong> folders, README, citations, version control</li>
  <li><strong>Mini-Capstone:</strong> pick a tiny dataset â†’ ask a question â†’ make a figure</li>
  <li><strong>Share:</strong> 3-minute lightning talk + 1-page summary</li>
</ol>

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Self-paced modules with progress checklists and optional challenges</li>
  <li>Mentor feedback via GitHub Issues/PRs; simple rubrics for each module</li>
  <li>No prior coding required; all materials and starter files provided</li>
</ul>
