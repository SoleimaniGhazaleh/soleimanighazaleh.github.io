<p>
This project investigates how electric field modeling and individualized neuroimaging data can guide transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interventions for substance use disorders. We collect structural and fMRI drug cue reactivity data prior to stimulation, and perform rapid analysis to define individualized targets based on functional connectivity between subcortical regions and the prefrontal cortex. Computational head models are then used to optimize coil orientation, and stimulation intensity is adjusted based on each participantâ€™s scalp-to-cortex distance.

<p>
A preregistered, randomized, triple-blind crossover clinical trial investigating the effects of theta-phase synchronized transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on fMRI drug cue reactivity, functional connectivity, and behavioral performance. Sixty participants with opioid use disorder received 20 minutes of active or sham theta-band (4â€“7 Hz) tACS via 4Ã—1 HD electrode montages targeting the frontoparietal network (F4 and P4). Structural MRI, resting-state fMRI, and drug cue reactivity scans were collected immediately before and after stimulation.
