## 🌍 International Network of tES/TMS Trials for Addiction Medicine (INTAM)

I serve as the **Executive Director** of INTAM — a global initiative that unites researchers, clinicians, and engineers to accelerate the development and implementation of non-invasive brain stimulation (tES/TMS) for the treatment of addiction.  
The network was founded and is scientifically led by [Dr. Hamed Ekhtiari](https://www.laureateinstitute.org/hamed-ekhtiari.html) and [Dr. Colleen Hanlon](https://www.brainsway.com/company/colleen-hanlon/), who continue to shape its strategic direction and vision.
